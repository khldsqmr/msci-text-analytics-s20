Are the words most similar to “good” positive, and words most similar to “bad” negative? Why this is or isn’t the case? Explain your intuition?

We observe that most of the words similar to "good" are positive i.e., decent, great, nice, etc. Similarly most of the words similar to "bad" are negative i.e., horrible, terrible, awful, etc. However, there are few exceptions. For instance, we find 'bad', 'poor' and 'terrible' in the list of most similar words for 'good'; and we also observe 'good' and 'funny' in the list of most similar words for 'bad'. This is either because of semantics or because of contextual usage. Since 'good' and 'bad' are perfect antonyms, there vectors are similar. This is because Word2Vec model predicts similarity of words based on the context of the word being used. For example, in the sentence "My daughter liked the shampoo", and "My daughter disliked the shampoo", the context/words in which 'liked' and 'disliked' are being used are similar.
